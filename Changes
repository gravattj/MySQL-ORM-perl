Revision history for MySQL-ORM

=======
0.16    - Don't add column to ResultX class if it already exists in Result.
          Example, current table has column called "enabled" and parent table has column
          "enabled". In these cases, we shouldn't add "enabled" to the ResultX
          class since it already exists in the Result class.

0.15    - Added a db attribute to the table classes in order to maintain a link
          back to the orm class. Mainly useful in CustomRoles which want to make
          use of methods defined in other CustomRoles on different tables.
        - Fixed selectx method generation to handle self referencing tables.
          Current solution was to not support selectx fetching the parent table
          attributes when the parent table == current table.
        - Better handling of dbh clone

0.14    - Added dbh clone disconnect on destroy logic to avoid warning messages
          if the clone was created while autocommit was off or a transaction
          was open.
